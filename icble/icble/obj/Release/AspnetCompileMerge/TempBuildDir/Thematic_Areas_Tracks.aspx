                            <p>In alignment with the core purpose of the conference to identify the best strategies in
                                blended teaching-learning, it would be organized into a few thematic areas. These areas
                                would primarily focus on the key aspects of operationalizing RAES – technology for
                                education delivery, e-Learning content, partnerships for sustainability and system-wide
                                capacity building. The themes are contemporary and relevant, and the outcome of
                                discussions would be to identify the best possible models for each given the context of
                                agricultural higher education. To this end, the discussions would draw upon learning
                                from global leading practices, current global dialogues, stakeholder perceptions and
                                empirical evidence of efficacy. The Conference would be guided by four thematic areas
                                and one thematic track, for which a special symposium would be organized. In the table
                                below, each of the thematic areas and thematic track has been described and key
                                questions of exploration articulated.</p>
